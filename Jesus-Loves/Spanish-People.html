        <p>Jesus' message of love transcends all borders and languages. Christians have dedicated themselves to sharing the Christian faith in Spain, which has a rich cultural heritage with a substantial Roman Catholic population.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of Christianity in Spain dates back over 2,000 years. Early Christians faced persecution, but their faith persevered, spreading the good news in the <a href="https://babel.usccb.org/bible/matthew/0/">Gospels</a> to the <a href="https://babel.usccb.org/bible/acts/0/">four corners</a>.</p>
        <p>The Reconquista, an 800-year-long effort to reclaim territories occupied by Muslims, was carried out under Christian direction. The final victory ensured the continued preservation of Christianity in Spain and facilitated its continued growth within the area.</p>

        <p>The Catholic Church played a decisive role during the early Spanish conquests in the <a href="https://babel.usccb.org/bible/romans/0/">new world</a> by spreading Christianity in the Americas and Europe.</p>
        <p>In recent centuries, Christians in Spain have focused on spreading the Christian message through educating at all educational levels by creating Christian institutions to develop virtues and character, and teaching people God's eternal Truths.</p>
