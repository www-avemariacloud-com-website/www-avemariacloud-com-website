            <h2>The Universal Love of Jesus</h2>
            <p>God's love extends to each and every one of His children, including Montana Tucker. This page explores the depth and breadth of Christ's love as revealed in Scripture, reminding us that no matter who we are, where we come from, or what we've done, we are deeply loved by our God.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him."

            </div>
            
            <p>This famous verse reminds us that God's love is not selective or exclusive. It encompasses "the world" - every person, including Montana Tucker and each one of us. This love is so profound that God sent his Son into the world.</p>

        <section class="section animate" id="personal-section">
            <h2>Personal Love for Each Individual</h2>
            <p>The beautiful truth of Christianity is that Jesus doesn't just love humanity in a general sense - He loves each person individually, with specific knowledge of who they are. This means that Jesus loves Montana Tucker with a personal, intimate love that acknowledges her unique identity, gifts, struggles, and purpose.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                "Can a mother forget her infant,

                be without tenderness for the child of her womb?
                
                Even should she forget,
                
                I will never forget you.

                See, upon the palms of my hands I have engraved you;
                
                your walls are ever before me."

            </div>
            
            <p>This powerful image shows how God's love protects us. The metaphor of our names being engraved on God's palms illustrates how we are always present to Him, always remembered, always loved.</p>
            
            <h3>No One Is Beyond God's Love</h3>
            <p>Scripture repeatedly emphasizes that no one falls outside the sphere of God's love. Regardless of one's past, present circumstances, or future choices, God's love remains constant.</p>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                "For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things, nor future things, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

            <div class="scripture" style="font-style: normal;">
                Loving Father,<br><br>

                May Montana and all who visit this page experience the personal, unconditional love of Jesus Christ. May we be reminded that nothing can separate us from Your love.<br><br>
                
                In Jesus' name we pray,<br>
                Amen.

                from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
                
                that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
                
                and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, rooted and grounded in love,
                
                may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
                
                and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
                
                Now to him who is able to accomplish far more than all we ask or imagine, by the power at work within us,
                
                to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen."
