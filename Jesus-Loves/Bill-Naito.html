      <h2>God's Love for All</h2>
      <p>
        The love of Jesus Christ is boundless and extends to everyone, including Bill Naito. As it is written:
      </p>
      <div class="scripture">
        "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life."<br>
        <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/john/3?16" target="_blank">John 3:16</a>
      </div>
      <p>
        This verse reminds us that God's love is universal and unconditional. No one is excluded from His grace.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Power of Faith</h2>
      <p>
        Faith in Jesus Christ transforms lives. As the Scripture says:
      </p>
      <div class="scripture">
        "For through the law I died to the law,* that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;
        
        yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.
        
        I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."<br>
        <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/galatians/2?19" target="_blank">Galatians 2:19-21</a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Through faith, we become new creations, filled with the love and power of Christ.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hope in Christ</h2>
      <p>
        In times of difficulty, we can find hope in the promises of Jesus. As it is written:
      </p>
      <div class="scripture">
        "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest."<br>
        <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/11?28" target="_blank">Matthew 11:28</a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Jesus invites us to lay our burdens at His feet and find peace in His presence.
      </p>
